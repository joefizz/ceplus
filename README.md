Cyber Essentials Plus attachment emailer

 This is a script built to assist with end user device checks for Cyber Essentials Plus.
 The use is hopefully fairly obvious - Enter an email address, select files (or not), and send.

 This script requires PHP > 5.5, and also the PHPMailer library to be installed in a reference path.
 PHPLibrary is available from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.
 
 Also requires jquery for the 'Select all' checkbox.  built using jquery-3.3.1.min.js

 Please update the Server Settings section with your required email settings.
